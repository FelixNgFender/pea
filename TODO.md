  - EX1: The n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the `Head` and
    `MultiHeadAttention` into one class that processes all the heads in
    parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in
    nanoGPT).
  - EX2: Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other data could be
    fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT
    to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to
    predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm
    (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want
    to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the
    generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the
    input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the
    targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to
    add? Once you have this, swole doge project: build a calculator clone in
    GPT, for all of +-\*/. Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought
    traces.)
  - EX3: Find a dataset that is very large, so large that you can't see a gap
    between train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then
    initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a
    smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower
    validation loss by the use of pretraining?
  - EX4: Read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or
    change that people seem to use. Does it improve the performance of your GPT?
